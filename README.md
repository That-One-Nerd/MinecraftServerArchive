# The Minecraft Server Archive

Hello. I run Minecraft servers with my friends. When the servers are complete, I upload their final backup here for anyone to check out and use.

Because these save files get so large, I will keep the unzipped worlds here as separate branches. Also, check the releases page for the compressed files you can download.
